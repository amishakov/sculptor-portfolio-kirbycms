Biography:

Flore Faucheux is a multidisciplinary artist, trained outside of academic circuits. Since 2020, she has focused on the practice of ceramics, where she works with stoneware in unconventional ways. A prolific solitary production where she aims to reproduce, in diverted scales and in a whimsical way, the products of our era. Flore Faucheux organizes her life in a cyclical manner.

She alternates between long travels and residencies in creative spaces, places that enrich the repertoire of things she sees and captures. Currently, she is working in Sous Terre[1] to bring out the markers of our time. By reproducing packaging of objects, she highlights modes of existence and consumption specific to our society. A way for the artist to find in her practice a personal space, which speaks to everyone. Paradox of value, does Flore Faucheux perpetuate with stoneware insignificant objects: preservation as a denunciation?

By choosing visual elements that characterize the places she travels through: a Jackpot grid thrown on a sidewalk, a cigarette pack abandoned on an empty table, a dirty sock forgotten in a corner of an apartment, she glorifies these ghost objects and compiles a meticulous inventory of a world in full transformation. Her colorful and shiny pieces disturb the relationships we have with everyday objects and their uses, a delicate awakening to a poetry of possession.[1] Ceramic studio located in the 10th arrondissement of Paris.
