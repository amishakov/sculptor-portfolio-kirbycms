Description:

Since May, during her residency at Jeanne Barret, Flore Faucheux has been meticulously preparing 'A Room Apart', a captivating installation project that immerses the visitor in the essence of adolescence. This exemplar room, a space out of time, oscillates between different eras, offering a window into a frozen moment of youth. The installation aims to create an experience of artistic voyeurism, where the spectator becomes a witness to the imagined intimacy of an imaginary inhabitant.

Each object in this room, entirely crafted in glazed stoneware, contributes to an immersive world, rich in stories and emotions. 'A Room Apart' is not just an exhibition; it's an invitation to travel into an adolescent universe, where every detail tells a unique story. This installation is the first chapter of the innovative 'Pièce(s) à vivre' series, an artistic exploration of living spaces that intertwines art, memory, and imagination. Through this series, Flore Faucheux redefines personal space as a canvas for artistic expression, inviting viewers to rediscover familiar places in a new and deeply personal light.
